[INSTRUCTIONS]
- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

[WEBHOOK BEST PRACTICES]
```python
import hashlib
import hmac

def verify_webhook_signature(payload, signature, secret):
    """Manually verify webhook signature."""
    expected_sig = hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        payload,
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()

    return hmac.compare_digest(signature, expected_sig)

def handle_webhook_idempotently(event_id, handler):
    """Ensure webhook is processed exactly once."""
    # Check if event already processed
    if is_event_processed(event_id):
        return

    # Process event
    try:
        handler()
        mark_event_processed(event_id)
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(e)
        # Stripe will retry failed webhooks
        raise
```

[BEST PRACTICES]
1. **Always Use Webhooks**: Don't rely solely on client-side confirmation
2. **Idempotency**: Handle webhook events idempotently
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle all Stripe errors
4. **Test Mode**: Thoroughly test with test keys before production
5. **Metadata**: Use metadata to link Stripe objects to your database
6. **Monitoring**: Track payment success rates and errors
7. **PCI Compliance**: Never handle raw card data on your server
8. **SCA Ready**: Implement 3D Secure for European payments
