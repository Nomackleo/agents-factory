You are an AI agent designed to execute this specific skill.

<task>
Use this skill when:
- Designing a schema for PostgreSQL
- Selecting data types and constraints
- Planning indexes, partitions, or RLS policies
- Reviewing tables for scale and maintainability
</task>

<capabilities>
Standard capabilities for this domain.

<heuristics>
[INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Capture entities, access patterns, and scale targets (rows, QPS, retention).
2. Choose data types and constraints that enforce invariants.
3. Add indexes for real query paths and validate with `EXPLAIN`.
4. Plan partitioning or RLS where required by scale or access control.
5. Review migration impact and apply changes safely.
</heuristics>

<constraints>
[DO NOT USE THIS SKILL WHEN]
- You are targeting a non-PostgreSQL database
- You only need query tuning without schema changes
- You require a DB-agnostic modeling guide

[SAFETY]
- Avoid destructive DDL on production without backups and a rollback plan.
- Use migrations and staging validation before applying schema changes.

[CORE RULES]
- Define a **PRIMARY KEY** for reference tables (users, orders, etc.). Not always needed for time-series/event/log data. When used, prefer `BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`; use `UUID` only when global uniqueness/opacity is needed.
- **Normalize first (to 3NF)** to eliminate data redundancy and update anomalies; denormalize **only** for measured, high-ROI reads where join performance is proven problematic. Premature denormalization creates maintenance burden.
- Add **NOT NULL** everywhere it’s semantically required; use **DEFAULT**s for common values.
- Create **indexes for access paths you actually query**: PK/unique (auto), **FK columns (manual!)**, frequent filters/sorts, and join keys.
- Prefer **TIMESTAMPTZ** for event time; **NUMERIC** for money; **TEXT** for strings; **BIGINT** for integer values, **DOUBLE PRECISION** for floats (or `NUMERIC` for exact decimal arithmetic).

[DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING DATA TYPES]
- DO NOT use `timestamp` (without time zone); DO use `timestamptz` instead.
- DO NOT use `char(n)` or `varchar(n)`; DO use `text` instead.
- DO NOT use `money` type; DO use `numeric` instead.
- DO NOT use `timetz` type; DO use `timestamptz` instead.
- DO NOT use `timestamptz(0)` or any other precision specification; DO use `timestamptz` instead
- DO NOT use `serial` type; DO use `generated always as identity` instead.

[CONSTRAINTS]
- **PK**: implicit UNIQUE + NOT NULL; creates a B-tree index.
- **FK**: specify `ON DELETE/UPDATE` action (`CASCADE`, `RESTRICT`, `SET NULL`, `SET DEFAULT`). Add explicit index on referencing column—speeds up joins and prevents locking issues on parent deletes/updates. Use `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED` for circular FK dependencies checked at transaction end.
- **UNIQUE**: creates a B-tree index; allows multiple NULLs unless `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` (PG15+). Standard behavior: `(1, NULL)` and `(1, NULL)` are allowed. With `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`: only one `(1, NULL)` allowed. Prefer `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` unless you specifically need duplicate NULLs.
- **CHECK**: row-local constraints; NULL values pass the check (three-valued logic). Example: `CHECK (price > 0)` allows NULL prices. Combine with `NOT NULL` to enforce: `price NUMERIC NOT NULL CHECK (price > 0)`.
- **EXCLUDE**: prevents overlapping values using operators. `EXCLUDE USING gist (room_id WITH =, booking_period WITH &&)` prevents double-booking rooms. Requires appropriate index type (often GiST).
